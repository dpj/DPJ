<BR>
Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) is an extension to the Java
programming language that guarantees <EM>determinism</EM> for programs
written with fork-join parallelism. That is, if a DPJ program
compiles without errors or warnings, then it will produce the same
output on every execution of the program. DPJ achieves its
determinism guarantee by enforcing <EM>noninterference</EM>: DPJ
guarantees that for any two parallel tasks, there are no pairs of
<EM>conflicting accesses</EM> (i.e., accesses to the same memory
location, with at least one a write) performed by the tasks.<BR>
<BR>
DPJ's determinism guarantee provides a significant benefit over
traditional models such as Java threads. In such models, conflicting
memory accesses and even data races can occur, so the behavior of the
program can vary depending on the interleaving of operations from
different threads on each execution. Such nondeterminism makes many
parallel programs difficult to reason about and hard to debug.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this tutorial is to bring you up to speed quickly using
DPJ. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:overview">2</A> gives an overview of major DPJ
concepts, so you can start writing programs as quickly as possible.
It provides links to <EM>The Deterministic Parallel Java Language Reference Manual</EM> (e.g., Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;1) so you
can look up particular features there to get more detail. The rest of
the sections show how to write common parallel patterns in DPJ. We
believe that a very good way to get started with DPJ is to (1) look
for patterns in this guide that are the same as or similar to patterns
occurring in your parallel algorithm; (2) study and understand the
relevant pattern or patterns in this guide; and (3) adapt the pattern
or patterns to your needs.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout this tutorial are DPJ code examples. Some are fragments of
larger programs, but many are short, self-contained programs. We
recommend that, before reading this tutorial, you download and install
DPJ. See <EM>The Deterministic Parallel Java Installation Manual</EM> for instructions on how to do it. Then, as
you read this tutorial, you can compile and run the examples. The
examples in this tutorial are located in the directory
<TT>Documentation/v1.1/Source/Tutorial/Programs</TT> of the DPJ release
at <TT>github.com/dpj/DPJ</TT>. They may be compiled and run from that
directory.<BR>

DPJ is based on Java. If you know Java, then you know most of DPJ
already. In fact, every legal Java program is a legal DPJ program!
However, the reverse is not true, because DPJ adds several features to
Java to guarantee determinism for parallel programs. We'll start with
the DPJ equivalent of &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; to explain the most basic DPJ
features.<BR>

<!--TOC subsubsection 2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A Simple DPJ Point Class-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><A NAME="htoc4">2.1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A Simple DPJ Point Class<A NAME="sec:overview:basic:simple"></A></H4><!--SEC END -->

At the most fundamental level, DPJ adds just three concepts to Java:
explicit fork-join parallelism, regions, and effects.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A> shows a simple DPJ class <TT>Point</TT> that
illustrates the concepts.

<B>Explicit fork-join parallelism:</B> The DPJ language syntax shows
explicitly where a parallel code section begins (a fork point) and
ends (the join point). At a join point, execution is suspended until
all the parallel tasks created at the corresponding fork point have
finished executing. In Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A>, the <TT>cobegin</TT>
statement (lines 10&ndash;13) executes its component statements (lines 11
and 12) in parallel. The fork point is at the start of the
<TT>cobegin</TT> statement, and the join point is at the end of the
statement. Execution does not continue after the <TT>cobegin</TT>
statement until lines 9 and 10 have both completed execution.<BR>
<BR>
DPJ's fork-join model makes the structure of the parallelism explicit,
in contrast to an unstructured model such as Java threads. Together
with the determinism guarantee, this structure allows the programmer
to reason about the behavior of the parallel program as if it were the
equivalent sequential program with the parallel constructs elided.
For example, DPJ guarantees that the code shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A> will compute the same results as the code in
which the <TT>cobegin</TT> statement in lines 10&ndash;13 were replaced with
an ordinary sequential statement block. Thus we say that DPJ has a
sequential <EM>correctness model</EM> and a parallel <EM>performance
 model</EM>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Regions:</B> To facilitate the analysis of reads and writes to
the heap, DPJ groups memory locations into named sets called
<EM>regions</EM>. The programmer explicitly partitions the heap into
regions by marking class fields and array cells with region
information. In Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A>, line 2 declares region
names <TT>X</TT> and <TT>Y</TT>. Lines 3 and 4 say that field <TT>x</TT> is
located in region <TT>X</TT> and field <TT>y</TT> is located in region
<TT>Y</TT>. Two or more variables may be grouped in the same region.
For example, it would be permissible to add a field <TT>double z in
 Y</TT> to class <TT>Point</TT>. However, every variable always resides in
exactly one region.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Effects:</B> The DPJ compiler infers the read and write effects
of each statement in the program in terms of regions. For example, in
line 5 of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A>, the effect of the statement
<TT>this.x = x</TT> is <TT>writes X</TT>, because the statement assigns a
value to variable <TT>x</TT>, which is declared to be in region <TT>X</TT>
(line 3).<BR>
<BR>
To make the compiler analysis simple and modular, and to document the
effects at API boundaries, the DPJ programmer writes <EM>effect
 summaries</EM> on methods that specify their read and write effects in
terms of regions. Examples of effect summaries are shown in lines 5,
6, and 8 of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A>. The compiler checks that every
method's summary includes all the actual effects of the method body
(including the effects of methods called in the body, using those
methods' summaries to compute the effects of the invocations). For
example, in line 8, it would be a compile-time error to omit the
effect <TT>writes Y</TT> from the summary of <TT>setXAndY</TT>, because of
the write to region <TT>Y</TT> in line 12.<BR>
<BR>
The compiler uses the inferred statement effects and method effect
summaries to compute the effects of parallel tasks, and check that all
pairs of parallel tasks are mutually noninterfering. For example, the
effect of line 9 is <TT>writes X</TT>, and the effect of line 10 is
<TT>writes Y</TT>. Because <TT>X</TT> and <TT>Y</TT> name different regions,
the two writes are to disjoint memory locations, so the parallel tasks
in the <TT>cobegin</TT> statement are safe to run in parallel. <BR>
<BR>
Some effects don't need to be reported in a method summary. These
are:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Any read or write of a local variable (i.e., a variable declared
 inside method scope, including method formal parameters). For
 instance, the read of parameter <TT>x</TT> in line 10 doesn't generate
 any effect that needs to be reported. That's because Java doesn't
 allow you to take the reference of a local variable, so the compiler
 can confirm noninterference for local variables without any help
 from the programmer.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Any effect on a <TT>final</TT> variable. That's because the value
 of a <TT>final</TT> variable never changes after it is initialized, so
 reading it cannot cause interference.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Any initialization effect on fields of <TT>this</TT> by a
 constructor. That's because in DPJ, other parallel tasks can never
 see the constructed object until all the initialization is done.
</UL>
<!--TOC subsubsection 2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling the Point Class-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><A NAME="htoc5">2.1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling the Point Class<A NAME="sec:overview:basic:compiling"></A></H4><!--SEC END -->

Try compiling the <TT>Point</TT> class shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A>. If your DPJ environment is set up
correctly, it should compile with no errors or warnings.<BR>
<BR>
Now try modifying the example a bit to see how DPJ responds to the
changes. Playing around with programs like this is one of the best
ways to learn new language features.<BR>
<BR>
First, delete <TT>in X</TT> at the end of line 3, and recompile. You
should get an error that the effect summary <TT>writes X</TT> in line 5
doesn't cover the effects of the method <TT>setX</TT>. That's because
when you take out the explicit declaration <TT>in X</TT>, the variable
<TT>x</TT> gets put in a default region called <TT>Root</TT>. Now replace
<TT>writes X</TT> in line 5 with <TT>writes Root</TT>. The code should
compile again without errors.<BR>
<BR>
Now delete the effect summary in line 5 entirely. This time the
code should compile, but it gives a warning. Since you didn't give
any explicit effect summary for <TT>setX</TT>, the compiler assumes the
most conservative effect for that method &mdash; in effect, &#8220;writes the
entire heap.&#8221; The code compiles, because the assumed effect
covers the effects of <TT>setX</TT>. However, the assumed effect
conflicts with the effect <TT>writes Y</TT> of <TT>setY</TT>. So the
compiler is warning you that there is potential interference between
lines 11 and 12 in the <TT>cobegin</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
Please notice three things about this example. First, there really
isn't any interference; the compiler is just warning you because you
haven't satisfied all its rules for <EM>proving</EM> there is no
interference. This may seem like a minor point for this trivial
class, but for a large and complex program, proving determinism can be
quite tricky. So following the rules is important, because it gives a
<EM>guarantee</EM> of correctness that would otherwise be hard to show.<BR>
<BR>
Second, notice that the DPJ compiler gives an error when your declared
method effects are too small, but a warning when your parallel effects
are interfering. This behavior is so that you can write a DPJ program
incrementally, without getting all the annotations right on the first
go. For example, you could have written the class in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A> by putting in the <TT>cobegin</TT> first,
leaving out the region and effect annotations entirely. That code
would compile, but it would give a warning. Then you could add the
region and effect annotations incrementally, until the warnings go
away. This is usually a good strategy for writing programs in DPJ.
Writing bad method effects causes an error (not just a warning)
because it is both easier to deal with (if you write nothing you get
the default effect, which always works) and less localized &mdash; a bad
method effect in one place could cause interference to be
underreported in a different one.<BR>
<BR>
Third, the defaults are designed so that you don't have to worry about
region and effect annotations for code that is never called inside a
parallel task. You only need to annotate code that is going to run in
parallel.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection 2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Where To Learn More-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><A NAME="htoc6">2.1.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where To Learn More<A NAME="sec:overview:basic:where-tolearn"></A></H4><!--SEC END -->

The Reference Manual has more detailed information on the topics
discussed above. In addition to <TT>cobegin</TT> for parallel
statements, DPJ has a <TT>foreach</TT> construct for parallel loop
iterations. See Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;6 for more details. Reference
Manual &sect;&sect;&nbsp;2.1 and 2.2 have more information on declaring and using
regions. For further information about summarizing and checking
effects, see the following sections of the Reference Manual:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
&sect;&sect;&nbsp;2.3.1, 2.3.2, and 6.2 explain how to write method effect summaries.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">&sect;&nbsp;6.4 explains how the compiler computes a method's actual effects.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">&sect;&nbsp;6.6 explains how the compiler compares a method's actual effects to
its summarized effects.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">&sect;&nbsp;6.7 explains noninterference of effect.
</UL>
It may be best to read at least the rest of this section of this
tutorial before consulting these sections of the reference manual,
because the full explanation of these features requires concepts (such
as region path lists and region parameters) introduced in later
subsections here. However, the Reference Manual contains plenty of
cross references (hyperlinked in the HTML version), so you can also
just start reading the Reference Manual, following cross references
when you don't understand something, if you prefer learning that way.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Region Path Lists-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc7">2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Region Path Lists<A NAME="sec:overview:rpls"></A></H3><!--SEC END -->

Every region in DPJ is described by a <EM>region path list</EM>, or RPL.
A basic region name, shown in &sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:overview:basic:simple">2.1.1</A>, is a
particular kind of RPL. More generally, a <EM>sequence of names</EM>
separated by colons is an RPL. For example, if <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT>
are declared region names, then <TT>A</TT>, <TT>B</TT>, <TT>A:B</TT>,
<TT>A:A:B</TT>, etc., are RPLs. RPLs can be <EM>partially specified</EM>,
by writing a <TT>*</TT> in place of some sequence of names. For example,
<TT>A:*:B</TT> stands in for <TT>A:B</TT>, <TT>A:A:B</TT>, <TT>A:B:B</TT>,
<TT>A:A:A:B</TT>, etc. Nesting and partial specification are useful for
describing <EM>sets of regions</EM> in effects. For example, in
conjunction with region parameters (&sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:overview:params">2.3</A>),
RPLs let you write an effect that says &#8220;writes all nodes in the left
subtree.&#8221;<BR>
<BR>
Here is a simple example of RPLs in action:

 <DIV CLASS="numbereddpjlisting"><TT><FONT SIZE=2>   1</FONT> <B>class</B> RPLExample {
<FONT SIZE=2>   2</FONT>     <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>region</B></FONT> A, B, C;
<FONT SIZE=2>   3</FONT>     <B>int</B> x <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>in</B></FONT> A:B;
<FONT SIZE=2>   4</FONT>     <B>int</B> y <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>in</B></FONT> A:C;
<FONT SIZE=2>   5</FONT>     <B>void</B> method(<B>int</B> x, <B>int</B> y)
<FONT SIZE=2>   6</FONT>         <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>writes</B></FONT> A:*
<FONT SIZE=2>   7</FONT>     {
<FONT SIZE=2>   8</FONT>         <B>this</B>.x = x;
<FONT SIZE=2>   9</FONT>         <B>this</B>.y = y;
<FONT SIZE=2>  10</FONT>     }
<FONT SIZE=2>  11</FONT> }</TT></DIV>
We have declared region names <TT>A</TT>, <TT>B</TT>, and <TT>C</TT> (line 2),
and we use them to construct the RPLs <TT>A:B</TT> and <TT>A:C</TT>. We put
field <TT>x</TT> in region <TT>A:B</TT> and field <TT>y</TT> in region
<TT>A:C</TT> (lines 3&ndash;4). In line 6, we use the partially specified RPL
<TT>A:*</TT> to cover both <TT>A:B</TT> and <TT>A:C</TT>. Note in particular
that <EM><TT>A</TT> and <TT>A:B</TT> are different regions</EM>. So
<TT>writes A</TT> does <EM>not</EM> cover a write to <TT>A:B</TT>; the <TT>*</TT>
is needed to get the inclusion. The reason is that to get more
precision with RPLs, DPJ separates the concepts of <EM>nesting</EM>
(<TT>A:B</TT> is nested under <TT>A</TT>) and <EM>inclusion</EM> (<TT>A:B</TT> is
included in <TT>A:*</TT> but not in <TT>A</TT>). It may help to think of
RPLs like a file system. For example, given the UNIX path
<TT>foo/bar</TT>, the file system is a tree with <TT>bar</TT> nested under
<TT>foo</TT>; but <TT>rm foo</TT> won't remove <TT>bar</TT>; you have to say
either <TT>rm foo/bar</TT> or <TT>rm foo/*</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
RPLs are useful in several ways:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Covering effects in method effect summaries, as shown in the
 example above.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Distinguishing different sets of regions from each other. For
 example, <TT>A:*</TT> is distinct from <TT>B:*</TT>, and <TT>*:A</TT> is
 distinct from <TT>*:B</TT>. This technique is useful for proving
 noninterference.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Describing partially specified types, to allow flexible
 assignments to variables with region arguments in their types. See
 the next section of this tutorial for more information.
</UL>
Later sections of this tutorial give more examples of using RPLs. For
the full details, see &sect;&sect;&nbsp;3 (RPLs), 5 (Types), and 6 (Effects) of the
Reference Manual.<BR>

<!--TOC subsection 2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Class and Method Region Parameters-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc8">2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Class and Method Region Parameters<A NAME="sec:overview:params"></A></H3><!--SEC END -->

<B>Class region parameters:</B> DPJ allows you to write classes with
region parameters. This works similarly to Java generic type
parameters and allows you to have different instances of the same
class with the fields in different regions.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a simple example to illustrate class region parameters:

Lines 1&ndash;3 define a simple <TT>Data</TT> class with an integer field
<TT>x</TT>. The class has one <EM>region parameter</EM>, <TT>R</TT>, and
field <TT>x</TT> is located in <TT>R</TT>. That means that when an object
of type <TT>Data&lt;r&gt;</TT> is created, for some actual region <TT>r</TT>, its
<TT>x</TT> field will reside region <TT>r</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the program is a simple class <TT>DataPair</TT> which stores
two <TT>Data</TT> objects in fields <TT>first</TT> and <TT>second</TT> (lines
6&ndash;7). Note that we have made the fields <TT>final</TT>. That is
because we are not going to assign into the fields themselves, as in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:overview">1</A>; instead we are going to read the fields and
assign into the objects they refer to. We do this in method
<TT>updateBoth</TT>. In line 19, the effect is <TT>writes First</TT>.
That's because the write is to field <TT>x</TT>, <TT>x</TT> is in region
<TT>R</TT> (line 2), and <TT>R=First</TT> in the type of the selector
<TT>first</TT>. See Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.4.1 for more information on
defining class region parameters, and Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;4 for more
information on using parametric classes as types. See Reference
Manual &sect;&nbsp;6.4 for more information on how the compiler computes the
effect of a field access through a parametric type.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Method region parameters:</B> Methods can also have region
parameters in DPJ. Method region parameters allow the same method to
be invoked with different regions. See Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.4.2.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Disjointness constraints on parameters:</B> You can put
disjointness constraints on class and method parameters. This allows
you, for example, to require that two parameters coming into a class
or method be different names. The requirement is checked by the
compiler at the point where the region arguments are given to the
parameters. Inside the class or method definition, the compiler can
use the disjointness constraint to prove noninterference. For
example, if two parameters are constrained to be disjoint, then
effects on them are disjoint. See Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.4.3 for
more details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Assignment restrictions:</B> In order to ensure sound reasoning
about types, some assignments aren't allowed when two types with the
same class have different region arguments. The rules are in
Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;5.1.2. Sometimes this means you can't do an
assignment you want to do. For example, if variable <TT>a</TT> has type
<TT>C&lt;A&gt;</TT> and <TT>b</TT> has type <TT>C&lt;B&gt;</TT>, you can't say <TT>b=a</TT>.
In this case, you have three options:
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
Use partially specified RPLs (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;3.4) and/or
 additional region parameters to express the assignment. DPJ's
 subtyping features are fairly powerful, so often you can do this.
 For example, if you give <TT>b</TT> the type <TT>C&lt;*&gt;</TT>, now you can
 assign <TT>a</TT> to it, as well as <TT>C&lt;B&gt;</TT> objects. However, the
 <TT>*</TT> causes the compiler to infer coarser information about
 effects. So this strategy doesn't always work.
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Clone an object with the new type. For example, <TT>b =
 a.&lt;B&gt;clone()</TT>. Here <TT>clone</TT> is a generic method that takes as an
 arguments the region parameter arguments of the outgoing object, and
 clones <TT>this</TT> with the new type:

 <DIV CLASS="dpjlisting"><TT>&lt;<FONT COLOR="blue"><B>region</B></FONT> Out&gt;C&lt;Out&gt;clone() {
    C&lt;Out&gt; result = <B>new</B> C&lt;Out&gt;();
    <FONT COLOR="fuchsia"><EM>// Copy fields from this to result</EM></FONT>
    ...
    <B>return</B> result;
}</TT></DIV>This strategy adds some overhead, which is a price of DPJ's
determinism guarantee in this case.
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">As a last resort, use a type cast (Reference Manual
 &sect;&nbsp;5.1.3). For example, <TT>b = (C&lt;B&gt;) a</TT>. This is usually not a
 good option, because it breaks DPJ's determinism guarantee.

<BR>
<BR>
DPJ v1.1 introduces a feature called an <EM>array class</EM> to support
parallel programming with arrays. An array class is like a Java class
with a single field, except the field has no name and it defines the
type of an array cell. For example, the following array class
describes an array of <TT>int</TT> cells all located in region <TT>R</TT>:

 <DIV CLASS="dpjlisting"><TT>arrayclass ArrayInt&lt;<FONT COLOR="blue"><B>region</B></FONT> R&gt; {
    <B>int <FONT COLOR="blue">in</FONT></B> R;
}</TT></DIV>Array classes are used similarly to Java arrays. Array class
instances are created by calling a constructor and specifying the
length, e.g., <TT>new ArrayInt&lt;r&gt;(10)</TT>. They are accessed using the
<TT>[&hellip;]</TT> dereference operator, just like normal Java arrays
(and they are in fact translated to normal Java arrays during
compilation). See Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;4 for more details.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes it's useful to put different array cells in different
regions, in particular if you want to update different parts of the
array in parallel. To do this, you use a DPJ feature called an
<EM>index-parameterized array class</EM>. For example, the following
array class defines an array of <TT>int</TT> such that cell <TT>i</TT> is in
region <TT>[i]</TT>:

 <DIV CLASS="dpjlisting"><TT>arrayclass IPArrayInt&lt;<FONT COLOR="blue"><B>region</B></FONT> R&gt; {
    <B>int <FONT COLOR="blue">in</FONT></B> R:[index];
}</TT></DIV>An RPL <TT>[<I>e</I>]</TT>, where <I>e</I> is an integer expression, is called an
<EM>array index RPL</EM>; it refers to the array index given by the
runtime value of <I>e</I>. Every array class has an <TT>index</TT> field that
refers to the index of a cell.<BR>
<BR>
The two strategies can also be mixed. For example, you can give array
<TT>A</TT> the type <TT>IPArrayInt&lt;rA&gt;</TT> and array <TT>B</TT> type
<TT>IPArrayInt&lt;rB&gt;</TT>. Then if you want to write in parallel to the
two arrays, you can express the effects on <TT>A</TT> as <TT>writes
 rA:[?]</TT> and the effects on <TT>B</TT> as <TT>writes rB:[?]</TT>. The
<TT>[?]</TT> is an RPL element that stands in for any array index element
(see Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;3.4.2). However, you can also express
disjoint effects on different parts of <TT>A</TT> or <TT>B</TT>. For
example, writing to cells 0 and 1 of <TT>A</TT> generates effects
<TT>writes rA:[0]</TT> and <TT>writes rA:[1]</TT>, which are disjoint.<BR>
<BR>
Index-parameterized arrays are also useful with arrays of class
objects and arrays of arrays. See Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;4 for more
information. Later sections of this tutorial also provide concrete
examples.<BR>

<!--TOC subsubsection 2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;DPJ Runtime Classes

<A NAME="sec:arrays:runtime"></A></H4><!--SEC END -->

<!--NAME arrays.runtime.html-->
<BR>
<BR>
The DPJ runtime provides several classes that are useful for
manipulating arrays. First, it provides array classes similar to
<TT>ArrayInt</TT> and <TT>IPArrayInt</TT> shown above for each of the Java
primitive types; there are also generic versions. Second, the DPJ
runtime provides classes <TT>ArraySlice</TT> and <TT>Partition</TT> for
manipulating subsections (i.e., &#8220;slices&#8221;) of arrays. These classes
are useful for divide and conquer traversals that update disjoint
parts of the same array.<BR>
<BR>
Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;8 gives an overview of how these classes work.
They are fully documented in the HTML documentation included with the
DPJ release. Later sections of this tutorial also give concrete
examples for how to use the classes.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that, as described in &sect;&nbsp;8 of the Reference Manual, it is
not sufficient to put the DPJ runtime classes in your class path when
compiling DPJ code that uses the runtime classes. Instead, you must
compile the runtime together with your code that depends on the
runtime. This is because the DPJ bytecode does not yet properly
support separate compilation of DPJ annotations, so the compiler needs
all the source code to process the annotations.

Here we explain how to use DPJ to create an array of objects, put a
different object into every element of the array, and then iterate
over the array in parallel and update the objects. We call this
pattern Disjoint Array Update. Because objects are stored as
references in Java, in general, multiple array cells could point to
the same object, causing a race. We'll show how to use the DPJ type
and effect system to ensure that no such race can occur.<BR>

Class <TT>Data</TT> (lines 2&ndash;7) has an integer field <TT>x</TT> and one
region parameter <TT>R</TT> (Reference Manual, &sect;&nbsp;2.4.1). The field
<TT>x</TT> is in region <TT>R</TT>; that means that when <TT>Data</TT> is used
as a type, the field of the object instance will be in whatever region
is supplied as an argument to the type. See Reference Manual,
&sect;&nbsp;5.1.1. The <TT>Data</TT> class also defines a static inner array
class <TT>Array</TT> representing an array of <TT>Data</TT> objects (lines
4&ndash;6). The <TT>Data.Array</TT> class is index-parameterized, as
discussed in &sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:arrays:array-classes">2.4.1</A>.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the code consists of an array <TT>arr</TT> of <TT>Data</TT>
objects and three methods that operate on the array:
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
<TT>initialize</TT> assigns a new array to <TT>arr</TT> and uses a
 <TT>foreach</TT> loop (Reference Manual, &sect;&nbsp;7.2) to assign a fresh
 <TT>Data</TT> object to every element of <TT>arr</TT> in parallel.
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate"><TT>compute</TT> increments the <TT>x</TT> field of each <TT>Data</TT>
 object in <TT>arr</TT> in parallel.
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate"><TT>main</TT> creates a new <TT>DisjointArrayUpdate</TT> object, calls
 <TT>initialize</TT> on it, then calls <TT>compute</TT> on it, prints out
 the array, and exits.
</OL>
The compiler can prove that the parallelism is safe because:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
In line 12, the update to <TT>arr[i]</TT> has effect <TT>writes
 [i]</TT>. The value of <TT>i</TT> is different in each loop iteration, so
 the updates are all to disjoint regions, i.e., there are no
 conflicting writes.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">In line 16, each iteration of the loop reads cell <TT>arr[i]</TT>
 (in region <TT>[i]</TT>) and writes field <TT>arr[i].x</TT>. Again, the
 operations are to disjoint regions in different iterations, so there
 is no interference.

force computation iterates in parallel over a disjoint array of
<TT>Body</TT> objects and writes into the <TT>force</TT> field of each one.<BR>

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc14">3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocked Array Update<A NAME="sec:array:blocked"></A></H3><!--SEC END -->

When you write a <TT>foreach</TT> loop in DPJ, the runtime repeatedly
divides the iteration space in half, until a programmer-specified
depth is reached. See Reference Manual, &sect;&nbsp;7.2.2. In conjunction
with an index-parameterized array that has each cell in its own region
(Reference Manual, &sect;&nbsp;4.3), this is usually the easiest and best way
to write a loop that traverses an array in parallel and updates its
elements. However, sometimes you may want to control the partition
directly, by dividing the array into blocks (or tiles) and having each
task operate on a block. We call this pattern Blocked Array Update.<BR>

The code uses the <TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> and <TT>PartitionInt</TT> classes
discussed in ReferenceManual, &sect;&nbsp;8, and the DPJ runtime documentation.
(<TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> and <TT>PartitionInt</TT> are specializations of
the <TT>ArraySlice</TT> and <TT>Partition</TT> classes to the primitive
type <TT>int</TT>.) Line 5 creates a fresh <TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> called
<TT>array</TT> with 100 elements. A <TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> wraps an ordinary
Java array (of type <TT>int[]</TT>) and behaves much like a
<TT>java.util.ArrayList</TT>: for example, it has <TT>put</TT> and <TT>get</TT>
methods for accessing the array elements. Lines 6&ndash;7 create a
<EM>strided partition</EM> of <TT>array</TT> called <TT>segs</TT>. The
partition has stride 10, which means that the array is divided into 10
segments of length 10 each. The variable <TT>segs</TT> is declared
<TT>final</TT> so that it can be used as a region (Reference Manual,
&sect;&nbsp;3.1.5).<BR>
<BR>
Lines 8&ndash;13 represent the parallel computation. The outer parallel
<TT>foreach</TT> loop iterates over the segments in <TT>segs</TT>. Line 4
pulls segment <TT>i</TT> out of the partition. Segment <TT>i</TT> is itself
a <TT>ArraySlice</TT>, representing the segment consisting of indices
10*<I>i</I> through 10*<I>i</I>+9 of the original array. Its type is
<TT>ArraySlice&lt;segs:[i]:*&gt;</TT>. As explained in Reference Manual, &sect;&nbsp;7.2,
the <TT>[i]</TT> in the type allows different segments of the same array
to be treated as disjoint, and the variable <TT>segs</TT> in the type
ensures that different partitions of the same array are not treated as
disjoint. For now, all you really need to know to write the pattern
is that you have to declare the partition variable <TT>segs</TT>
<TT>final</TT>, as shown in line 6, and you have to write the type of a
segment as shown in line 9.<BR>
<BR>
The inner sequential loop iterates over the elements of a segment and
writes values into its elements. Notice that in iteration <TT>i</TT> of
the outer loop, the inner loop is zero-indexed, even though it is
accessing elements 10*<I>i</I>, 10*<I>i</I>+1, &hellip; of the underlying array.
That's because when you create a <TT>Partition</TT> out of a
<TT>ArraySlice</TT>, each segment provides a zero-indexed <EM>view</EM> of
some segment of the original <TT>ArraySlice</TT>. The <TT>ArraySlice</TT> class
takes care of the index translation for you, which is handy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Further examples:</B> This pattern appears in the International
Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), in method <TT>Do</TT> of file
<TT>IDEATest.java</TT> in directory
<TT>Benchmarks/Applications/IDEA/dpj</TT> of the DPJ release. The
pattern is useful for IDEA, because the IDEA algorithm operates on
fixed-size blocks of the input data.<BR>
<BR>
This pattern is also useful for implementing reductions. See

A common pattern in parallel array algorithms is to divide an array in
pieces, and work independently on the pieces, then recursively divide
again, etc., until a base case is reached. This pattern is often

The code uses the <TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> and <TT>PartitionInt</TT>
classes also used for Blocked Array Update
(&sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:array:blocked">3.2</A>). The method <TT>recursiveInit</TT> (line 4)

done sequentially (lines 8&ndash;12). Otherwise the program creates a
<TT>Partition</TT> that splits the array in half. Lines 17&ndash;22
recursively and in parallel call <TT>recursiveInit</TT> on the halves.

This section shows how to use DPJ to implement a divide-and-conquer
build of a tree data structure. We show how to build the tree so it
can be used for a parallel algorithm that traverses and updates its
nodes. This requires that every node have a different region in its
type, and the regions have a tree structure. If read-only access to
the tree is desired, then the DPJ types can be simplified. We leave
that simplification to the reader as an exercise.

<B>How to write the pattern:</B> Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:tree:build">5</A>
illustrates the Recursive Tree Build pattern, for an algorithm that
builds a binary region tree for partitioning bodies in one-dimensional
space. In this kind of tree, the data (the bodies) are in the leaf
nodes; the inner nodes are there just to facilitate searching the
data. For example, computing whether a ray intersects a body can be
done in log(<I>n</I>) time, where <I>n</I> is the number of points.<BR>
<BR>
Lines 6&ndash;20 of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:tree:build">5</A> define the classes that the
algorithm uses:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Class <TT>Body</TT> (lines 6&ndash;9) defines a body with a mass and a
 position. The fields are declared <TT>final</TT>, so reading them has
 no effect.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Class <TT>Node</TT> (line 10) defines an abstract node of the tree.
 It contains a <TT>Body</TT> representing its center of mass. For a
 leaf node, this is an actual physical body; and for an inner node,
 this is the average of all the bodies in the leaves under the node.
 There is one region parameter <TT>R</TT>, so that different instances
 of <TT>Node</TT> can have different regions, and the <TT>centerOfMass</TT>
 field is in region <TT>R</TT>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Class <TT>InnerNode</TT> (lines 11&ndash;17) defines an inner node of
 the tree. It inherits the <TT>centerOfMass</TT> field from <TT>Node</TT>.
 Additionally, it has a left bound and a right bound, defining a
 region of 1-D space; and it has a left child and a right child,
 defining the tree. Here we have used the RPLs <TT>R:LeftRgn</TT> and
 <TT>R:RightRgn</TT> to give the region of the tree node a region
 structure that mirrors the tree structure. For example, at runtime,
 the left child of the right child of the root node would have the
 type <TT>Node&lt;Root:RightRgn:LeftRgn&gt;</TT>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Class <TT>LeafNode</TT> (lines 18&ndash;20) just adds a constructor to
 <TT>Node</TT>, so that a leaf node representing a physical body may be
 created.
</UL>
The rest of the code defines the methods that do the tree building:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Method <TT>computeSplitPoint</TT> (lines 21&ndash;30) is a helper method
 that takes an array of bodies and a point in space. It computes and
 returns the index into the array such that the elements to the left
 of the index are all and only the elements to the left of the point
 in space. The array is assumed to be sorted by position. We don't
 show this code. It can easily be implemented in parallel using a
 divide-and-conquer strategy.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Method <TT>makeTree</TT> (lines 31 and following) does the actual
 tree building and is discussed below.
</UL>
Method <TT>makeTree</TT> uses divide-and-conquer recursion to build the
tree. It takes an array of bodies to build into a tree (assumed to be
pre-sorted by position), and a left and right bound representing the
region of space that the tree is partitioning. It returns a node
representing the root of the tree. The method has two region
parameters, <TT>RN</TT> and <TT>RA</TT>. <TT>RN</TT> is the region associated
with the type of the node returned, while <TT>RA</TT> is the region
associated with the array of bodies coming in. The parameters are
constrained so that writes under <TT>RN</TT> and under <TT>RA</TT> are
noninterfering. (For example two different names <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT>
would satisfy this constraint, but <TT>A</TT> and <TT>A:B</TT> would not.)<BR>
<BR>
The body of <TT>makeTree</TT> does the following:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
If the input array is empty, return <TT>null</TT> (line 36).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">If the input array has just one element, then create a fresh
 leaf node for it (line 37).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Otherwise, handle the recursive case.
</UL>
The recursive case works as follows:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Compute the index into the array corresponding to the midpoint
 of the current region of space, and split the array there (lines
 38&ndash;40).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Make a new <TT>InnerNode</TT> corresponding to the current region
 of space (line 41).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">In parallel, populate the left and right children of the new
 inner node, by calling <TT>makeTree</TT> recursively (lines 42&ndash;47).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Return the created node (line 48).
</UL>
The interesting types and effects are inside the <TT>cobegin</TT>.
Notice that lines 43&ndash;44 call <TT>makeTree</TT> with
<TT>RN</TT>=<TT>RN:InnerNode.LeftRgn</TT>, which creates the right type
for assigning into <TT>node.leftChild</TT>. Notice also that the effects
of the two branches of the <TT>cobegin</TT> are <TT>reads RA:* writes
 RN:InnerNode.LeftRgn:*</TT> and <TT>reads RA:* writes
 RN:InnerNode.RightRgn:*</TT>, and these two effects are disjoint.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Further examples:</B> The file <TT>Quadtree.java</TT> in directory
<TT>Benchmarks/Kernels/dpj</TT> of the DPJ uses this pattern to build a
quadtree (i.e., a tree in which each node has up to four children) for
partitioning two-dimensional space. The main difference is that
index-parameterized arrays (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;4.3) are used instead
of the regions <TT>LeftRgn</TT> and <TT>RightRgn</TT> to distinguish the
different branches of the tree. The partition step is implemented
sequentially, but it could easily be parallelized.<BR>
<BR>
The Barnes-Hut benchmark in the DPJ release
(<TT>Benchmarks/Applications/Barnes-Hut/dpj</TT>) builds an octree for
partitioning three-dimensional space. The tree build phase is not
parallelized in that benchmark, but it could be using this pattern.<BR>

<DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>How to write the pattern:</B> Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:tree:update">6</A>
illustrates the Recursive Tree Update pattern, for an algorithm that
traverses the tree constructed in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:tree:build">5</A> and
updates the center of mass of each node. The work is done by a single
method, <TT>updateCenterOfMass</TT>, which accepts a tree node, updates
the center of mass fields of that node and all its descendants, and
returns the center of mass of that node.<BR>
<BR>
The method body works as follows. If the input node is a leaf node,
then the method just returns its body as the center of mass (lines
10&ndash;11). Otherwise, the method recursively and in parallel calls
<TT>updateCenterOfMass</TT> on the left and right nodes (lines 13&ndash;20)
and constructs a new <TT>Body</TT> representing the center of mass (lines
21&ndash;28). It then stores the <TT>Body</TT> representing the center of
mass into the input node and returns the <TT>Body</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
In lines 15&ndash;20, the effects of each of the two branches of the
<TT>cobegin</TT> statement are as shown. Because of the tree structure
of the regions of the tree nodes, the effects on the left and write
subtrees are disjoint.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Further examples:</B> The Barnes-Hut benchmark in the DPJ release
(<TT>Benchmarks/Applications/Barnes-Hut/dpj</TT>) does a similar
center-of-mass computation on an octtree. The center-of-mass phase is
not parallelized in that benchmark, but it could be using this
pattern.<BR>

<!--TOC section 5&nbsp;&nbsp;Computing with Local Objects-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc19">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Computing with Local Objects<A NAME="sec:local"></A></H2><!--SEC END -->

This section discusses a common parallel pattern that we call Local
Objects. Often an object is created by some task, and not seen by any
other task running in parallel with that one. Either it is used only
by the creating task, and its lifetime ends with that task; or it is
stored into global memory, but no reference to it is seen until after
all the parallel tasks have completed. We call this kind of object a
<EM>local object</EM>. Local objects are useful, because effects on
them by the creating task are hidden from other tasks running in
parallel, so the effects cannot cause interference.<BR>
<BR>
This section discusses two kinds of local objects:

<TT>usingLocalRegions</TT> (line 12 of
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:local:iteration:pattern">7</A>) illustrates the
Iteration-Local Objects pattern using local regions. Class
<TT>LocalObject</TT> (lines 4&ndash;10) has an integer field <TT>value</TT> and a
method <TT>produceValue</TT>. The <TT>produceValue</TT> method accepts an
integer value, stores it to the object's <TT>value</TT> field, and
returns it. The effect of <TT>produceValue</TT> is to write to <TT>R</TT>,
the region of the <TT>LocalObject</TT> type. The rest of the program
(lines 11 and following) creates an array and writes to it in
parallel. Line 11 creates an array of integers called <TT>results</TT>.
The array is index-parameterized (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;4.2.2), so that
every cell is in its own region.<BR>
<BR>
Line 18 produces two effects, both disjoint for distinct iterations of
the <TT>foreach</TT> loop at line 13. First, because <TT>results</TT> is
index-parameterized, the effect of the assignment to <TT>results[i]</TT>
is <TT>writes [i]</TT>; the write is to a different region for each value
of <TT>i</TT> in each distinct iteration. Second, the effect of invoking
<TT>produceValue</TT> is <TT>writes R</TT> with <TT>R</TT>=<TT>LocalRegion</TT>,
that is, <TT>writes LocalRegion</TT>. Since the scope of
<TT>LocalRegion</TT> is local to an iteration of the <TT>foreach</TT>, this
effect does not cause any interference across <TT>foreach</TT>
iterations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How to write the pattern with array regions:</B> Method
<TT>usingArrayRegions</TT> (line 21 of
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:local:iteration:pattern">7</A> illustrates the
Iteration-Local Objects pattern using array regions. The code is the
same as in method <TT>usingLocalRegions</TT>, except that instead of an
iteration-local region, it binds the array region <TT>[i]</TT> to the RPL
parameter of the <TT>LocalObject</TT> class in iteration <TT>i</TT> of the
<TT>foreach</TT> loop. The effect of invoking <TT>produceValue</TT> in line
14 is <TT>writes [i]</TT>, which is a distinct region for each iteration
of the loop.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Further examples:</B> The Monte Carlo benchmark in the DPJ
release uses the array region version of this pattern. Monte Carlo
operates in parallel on a set of independent tasks, and uses a local
object called <TT>PriceStock</TT>, parameterized by an iteration index
region, to store temporary data for processing the task. See the file

<B>How to write the pattern:</B>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:local:method:pattern">8</A> illustrates the Method-Local
Objects pattern with a simple sum reduction that also performs an
incidental computation on local data. Class <TT>LocalObject</TT> (lines
4&ndash;10) is the same as in &sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:local:iteration">5.1</A>. Method
<TT>sumReduce</TT> (lines 11 and following) takes as input a
<TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;8.2). In the base cases it
either does nothing (empty array) or returns the only value (array
with one element). Otherwise, it divides the array in half and
processes each half recursively and in parallel. This part of the
computation is similar to the Divide-and-Conquer Array Update pattern
(&sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:array:dandc">3.3</A>), except that the array is only read, not
written.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the computation (lines 20 and following) declares a local
region (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.3.3) called <TT>LocalRegion</TT>, and
creates a <TT>LocalObject</TT> with the local region as its RPL argument.
The effect of invoking <TT>localObject.produceValue</TT> in line 24 is
<TT>writes LocalRegion</TT>, as shown in line 23. This effect is a local
effect (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;5.3), so it doesn't have to be reported in
the declared effect of <TT>sumReduce</TT> (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.3.1).
The write effect on the <TT>LocalObject</TT> instance in each invocation
of <TT>sumReduce</TT> is therefore hidden, or <EM>masked</EM>, from the
callee, and doesn't cause any interference at the <TT>cobegin</TT> in
line 16.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Further examples:</B> The Collision Tree benchmark in the DPJ
release uses method-local objects. Collision Tree computes whether
two trees representing objects in space have any intersection, by
recursively traversing the trees in parallel. The computation is
read-only on the trees, but the computation on each tree node passes
results (a list of intersecting triangles) up to its parent. Before
recursively calling itself in parallel on two subtrees, the
<TT>intersect</TT> method creates fresh objects to hold the results
from one of the subtrees, placing their data in a local region.
The computation on the other subtree reuses the data structures 
used for the parent node, so the computations on the two subtrees
write their results to different regions and can be safely run in
parallel. See the file <TT>CollisionTree.java</TT> in the directory
<TT>Benchmarks/Applications/CollisionTree/src/com/jme/bounding</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
Method-local regions are also useful for algorithms that explore a
tree-shaped search space: for example, a recursive solver (such as a
tic-tac-toe or n queens solver). In such algorithms, typically some
local state (like a board position) is copied and sent to all possible
next moves. Each next move does its computation on its private copy
of the state, then returns its result to the parent. The private copy
of the state is a method-local object.<BR>

This section discusses how to implement associative reductions in DPJ.
A reduction is a common parallel pattern for computing a single datum
from a collection of data. The transformation from the collection of
data to the single datum is called &#8220;reducing&#8221; the collection. For
example, a sum reduction of a collection of integers sums all the
elements in the collection to produce a single integer representing
the sum.<BR>
<BR>
A reduction is <EM>associative</EM> if it can be represented as an
associative binary operation on the elements. For example, a sum
reduction is associative because it is represented by the binary
operation +, which is associative; that means that for any integers
<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, and <I>c</I>, <I>a</I>+(<I>b</I>+<I>c</I>)=(<I>a</I>+<I>b</I>)+<I>c</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How to write the pattern:</B> Associative reductions can be
written efficiently as parallel algorithms. There are at least two
ways to do it, both supported in DPJ:
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
<EM>Recursive reduction</EM> Use divide-and-conquer recursion.
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate"><EM>Iterative reduction</EM> Divide the input collection up into
 pieces, loop over all the pieces in parallel and reduce each piece
 to a partial result, then reduce the partial results to the final
 result, either sequentially or in parallel.
</OL>
Below we illustrate method (2) (iterative reduction).
&sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:local:method">5.2</A> shows an example of a divide-and-conquer sum
reduction.

<A NAME="fig:reductions:pattern"></A>
<DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:reductions:pattern">9</A> lists a simple DPJ program that
implements an iterative integer sum reduction. Line 4 declares a
private region <TT>AccumRgn</TT> for holding the accumulated results.
Line 5 declares an accumulation variable <TT>sum</TT> in <TT>AccumRgn</TT>.
Lines 6&ndash;8 give the signature for the public method <TT>reduce</TT>,
which takes a <TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> and a tile size (i.e., the number of
array elements to process in each task) and does the reduction.
Method <TT>reduce</TT> has a region parameter <TT>R</TT>, so a
<TT>ArraySliceInt</TT> with any RPL argument can be passed to its
<TT>arr</TT> parameter. The region parameter is declared so that binding
<TT>R=r</TT> at a call site must satisfy <TT>r:* # AccumRgn</TT> (Reference
Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.4.3). The method is declared to read under <TT>R</TT>
(because it is reading the array), and to write <TT>AccumRgn</TT>
(because it uses <TT>AccumRgn</TT> to compute the sum)<BR>
<BR>
The body of the <TT>reduce</TT> method sets <TT>sum</TT> to zero and uses a
blocked array to do the partial sums. The array blocking is similar
to Blocked Array Update (&sect;&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:array:blocked">3.2</A>), except the array
is only read, and not written. Inside the <TT>foreach</TT> loop (lines
14&ndash;20), there is a sequential partial sum computation, followed by a
global accumulation. The accumulation invokes the private method
<TT>updateSum</TT> (defined starting in line 23). That method is
declared <TT>commutative</TT> (Reference Manual &sect;&nbsp;2.3.4), because it is
properly synchronized to allow concurrent execution, and the operation
it performs commutes with itself. This is a typical way to write an
accumulation operation in DPJ. If the number of parallel tasks is
small, one could also have each task store its partial result into an
array cell, and then sum the elements of that array in a separate
sequential phase.<BR>
<BR>
Lines 29 and following show a <TT>main</TT> method that creates a new
integer array of size 1,000,000, initializes element 42 of the array
with the value 42, and calls <TT>reduce</TT> with a tile size of 1000.
Since Java initializes the other array cells to 0, hopefully the
answer is 42.<BR>
